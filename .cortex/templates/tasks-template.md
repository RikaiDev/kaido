  TASKS TEMPLATE - Task Breakdown by User Story
  Generated by: cortex.tasks <workflowId>
  
  IMPORTANT: Tasks are organized by user story to enable:
  - Independent implementation of each story
  - Independent testing of each story
  - Incremental delivery (MVP = User Story 1)

# Tasks: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Workflow ID**: [WORKFLOW_ID]  
**Input**: Design documents from `.cortex/workflows/[WORKFLOW_ID]/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[ID]**: Sequential task number (T001, T002, T003...)
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

**Examples**:
- `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement auth middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts`
- `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.ts`
- `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.ts`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

[SETUP_TASKS]

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

[FOUNDATIONAL_TASKS]

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [US1_TITLE] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [US1_GOAL]

**Why this priority**: [US1_WHY]

**Independent Test**: [US1_TEST_CRITERIA]

### Tests for User Story 1 (if TDD requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

[US1_TEST_TASKS]

### Implementation for User Story 1

[US1_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS]

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [US2_TITLE] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [US2_GOAL]

**Why this priority**: [US2_WHY]

**Independent Test**: [US2_TEST_CRITERIA]

### Tests for User Story 2 (if TDD requested) ⚠️

[US2_TEST_TASKS]

### Implementation for User Story 2

[US2_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS]

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

[ADDITIONAL_USER_STORY_PHASES]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

[POLISH_TASKS]

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

[USER_STORY_DEPENDENCIES_DETAIL]

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

[WAITING FOR USER CONFIRMATION]

**Next Steps**:
1. Review task breakdown carefully
2. Verify each user story is independently testable
3. Check parallel opportunities are correctly marked [P]
4. When ready, generate implementation checklist: `cortex.generateChecklist [WORKFLOW_ID] tasks`
5. Then start implementation: `cortex.implement [WORKFLOW_ID]`
